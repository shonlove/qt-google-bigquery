# Introduction #

The qt-google-bigquery example uses Google BigQuery API v2.
To use API you need to register your own application on Google.


# Details #

You need to login to Google, so first you need to create simple Google account.
Then you can visit the page

https://code.google.com/apis/console

there you can create your application. You need to check access to Google BigQuery API.
Right now you need to request for an access.

Then  you can see credentials of your application. You need to copy and paste **Api\_key**, **Client\_ID** and **Redirect\_URI** to the settings dialog available in menu: "File->API params".

After that you can rerun **qt-google-bigquery**.
